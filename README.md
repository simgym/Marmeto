This assignment is about creating a e-commerce webpage for prodcut details using only javascript , html and css without using any libraries or frameworks.

I have used media queries for ensuring responsive design.

Since the images from API were not accessible I copied the image from figma and stored them in images folder. It also contains tick icon used inside selected color and bag icon for add to cart option.

User can select quantity with default quantity as 1.

user can also select color and size of product.

When user clicks on add to cart then a message is displayed telling about choosen color and size of product.

I have also included the code to calculate the discount percentage using the actual price and the after discount price i got from api.

I used border property in css for error analysis and i have commented the part in css where i used it.

User can click on thumbnail to view it in larger scale.
